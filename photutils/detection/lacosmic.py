    Remove cosmic rays from a single astronomical image using the
    `L.A.Cosmic <http://www.astro.yale.edu/dokkum/lacosmic/>`_
    algorithm.  The algorithm is based on Laplacian edge detection and
    is described in `PASP 113, 1420 (2001)`_.

    .. _PASP 113, 1420 (2001):
        http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PASP..113.1420V

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like
        The 2D array of the image.

    contrast : float
        Contrast threshold between the Laplacian image and the
        fine-structure image.  If your image is critically sampled, use
        a value around 2.  If your image is undersampled (e.g. HST
        data), a value of 4 or 5 (or more) is more appropriate.  If your
        image is oversampled, use a value between 1 and 2.  For details,
        please see `PASP 113, 1420 (2001)`_, which calls this parameter
        :math:`f_{\mbox{lim}}`.  In particular, figure 4 shows the
        approximate relationship between the ``contrast`` parameter and
        the pixel full-width half-maximum of stars in your image.

    cr_threshold : float
        The Laplacian signal-to-noise ratio threshold for cosmic ray
        detection.

    neighbor_threshold : float
        The Laplacian signal-to-noise ratio threshold for detection of
        cosmic rays in pixels neighboring the initially-identified
        cosmic rays.

    error_image : array_like, optional
        The 2D array of the 1-sigma errors of the input ``image``.
        ``error_image`` must have the same shape as ``image``.  If
        ``error_image`` is not input, then ``gain`` and ``readnoise``
        will be used to construct an approximate model of the
        ``error_image``.  If ``error_image`` is input, it will override
        the ``gain`` and ``readnoise`` parameters.

    mask_image : array_like, bool, optional
        A boolean mask with the same shape as ``image``, where a `True`
        value indicates the corresponding element of ``image`` is
        ignored when identifying cosmic rays.  It is highly recommended
        that saturated stars be included in ``mask_image``.

    background : float or array_like, optional
        The background level previously subtracted from the input
        ``image``.  ``background`` may either be a scalar value or a 2D
        image with the same shape as the input ``image``.  If the input
        ``image`` has not been background-subtracted, then set
        ``background=None`` (default).

    gain : float, optional
        The gain factor that when multiplied by the input ``image``
        results in an image in units of electrons.  For example, if your
        input ``image`` is in units of ADU, then ``gain`` should
        represent electrons/ADU.  If your input ``image`` is in units of
        electrons/s then ``gain`` should be the exposure time.  ``gain``
        and ``readnoise`` must be specified if an ``error_image`` is not
        input.

    readnoise : float, optional
        The read noise (in electrons) in the input ``image``.  ``gain``
        and ``readnoise`` must be specified if an ``error_image`` is not
        input.

    maxiter : float, optional
        The maximum number of iterations.  The default is ``4``.  The
        routine will automatically exit if no additional cosmic rays are
        identified.  If the routine is still identifying cosmic rays
        after ``4`` iterations, then you are likely digging into sources
        (e.g. saturated stars) and/or the noise.  In that case, try
        inputing a ``mask_image`` or increasing the value of
        ``cr_threshold``.

    Returns
    -------
    cleaned_image : array_like
        The cosmic-ray cleaned image.

    crmask_image : array_like, bool
        A mask image of the identified cosmic rays.  Cosmic-ray pixels
        have a value of `True`.
